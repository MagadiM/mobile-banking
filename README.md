# Mobile Banking Application
A Flutter mobile banking application for Android users
This is my second flutter application and it is a guided project. The project will entail creation of a mobile banking app that accepts cash deposits, takes withdrawals, and other features like payment of bills and etc.

## The Home Page
The Home Page enatails a card that provides details of the user of the account, their account balance and has links that lead the account holder to other sections of the application. A user can only access the Home Page or Dashboard by logging into the application or registration. Once logged in, the user has access to handle different services open to them which will be linked with their account and their password.
